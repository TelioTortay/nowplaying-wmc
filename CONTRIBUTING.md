# Contributing to Custom Now Playing

Thanks for your interest! 🎉

**Important**: This is a personal project with **no guaranteed support**. I maintain it when I have time. Your mileage may vary!

## 🐛 Bug Reports

Open an issue with:
- OS and Python version
- Steps to reproduce
- Logs/screenshots

I'll look at it when I can, no promises on timeline.

## 💡 Feature Requests

Feel free to suggest, but **no guarantees** they'll be implemented. 

**Better option**: Fork the repo and add it yourself! That's what open source is for. 😊

## 🔧 Pull Requests

PRs are welcome! I'll review them when possible.

**No strict rules:**
- Make it work
- Don't break existing stuff
- Test it yourself

That's it. No need for perfection.

## 🐧 Linux Support - WANTED!

**This is the #1 priority contribution!**

Need someone to:
- Replace `winsdk` with `pydbus`
- Implement MPRIS2 support
- Test on Linux

If you do this, you're a legend and I'll credit you prominently! 🏆

## 🎨 New Themes

Want to create a custom theme? Cool!

**Requirements:**
- Use free fonts (Google Fonts recommended)
- Test with long track names (scrolling animation)
- Include color customization via CSS variables
- Provide a screenshot

Submit as `now-playing-widget-[name].html` with a short description.

Easy merge if it looks good!

## 📝 Documentation

Typo fixes, clarifications, screenshots - all good! Low effort, high value.

## ⚡ TL;DR

- **Fork freely**, no permission needed
- **PRs appreciated**, reviewed when possible  
- **Issues noted**, fixed when I have time
- **No SLA**, this is hobby time

**This is a "use and improve yourself" project, not a "wait for support" project.**

Thanks for understanding! 🙏
